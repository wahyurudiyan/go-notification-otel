# Open Telemetry Context Propagation Example

ðŸ“¡ Distributed Context Propagation Example using OpenTelemetry in Go

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project demonstrates how to propagate trace context across services using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in Go. It shows how HTTP and gRPC-based services can carry trace information such as trace ID and span ID to enable end-to-end observability in a distributed system.

**Context propagation** is a core concept in OpenTelemetry that enables telemetry signals (traces, metrics, logs) to be correlated across process and network boundaries by transmitting trace context (e.g., `traceparent` headers).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Show how to propagate trace context between services (HTTP and gRPC).
- Use OpenTelemetry Go SDK to instrument services.
- Export trace data to Jaeger.
- Implement graceful shutdown for all services.
- Provide reusable modules for setting up telemetry and context handling.

## âœ… Graceful Shutdown

The project includes safe shutdown handling using the graceful package. This ensures services flush telemetry data and release resources before terminating.
